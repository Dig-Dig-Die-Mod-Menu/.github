## 🌑 A Descent with Choice

Every descent underground is a quiet poem written in dust and danger. In **Dig, Dig, Die**, the world does not forgive hesitation — hunger gnaws, enemies listen, and the dark remembers every mistake.

The **Dig, Dig, Die Mod Menu** exists for those who want to *listen back* to the game. Not to silence it, but to answer. To slow the fall, sharpen awareness, and bend systems just enough to let curiosity breathe.

This is not chaos. This is control with restraint.

## 🧭 What the Mod Menu Is

The mod menu is a real-time in-game overlay that unlocks hidden layers of customization. Instead of rigid presets, you receive sliders, toggles, and subtle switches — tools to sculpt your own survival rhythm.

It works entirely in-session, leaving save files untouched and performance undisturbed.

**Think sandbox, not shortcut.**
